# Snail Habitat with photo capture
Snail habitat with a Raspberry Pi computer + camera attached to it for capturing a history of photos. The photos post to AWS and display on a web page.

This was project done in a classroom with 22 students. We broke the kids out into groups and created 5 snail habitats. It would be a great project to do school wide too, where you create 1 snail habitat per class. This would allow the entire school to get involved and monitor each others habitats. 

You can follow the project and live habitats at https://www.snailhabitat.com/. I would love to see others habitats, so if you create one, please share it and I would be happy to publish it on snailhabitat.com
